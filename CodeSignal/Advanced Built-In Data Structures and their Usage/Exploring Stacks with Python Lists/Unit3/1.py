# Simulating the rotation of items, ensuring the order doesn't matter for SortedDict
# Convert SortedDict to a list of items, perform the rotation directly without ensuring order, and convert back
items = list(population_dict.items())  # Convert to list of tuples
rotated_items = items[1:] + items[:1]  # Perform the rotation
rotated_dict = SortedDict(rotated_items)  # Convert back to the dict

print('Country at the start after one rotation:', rotated_dict.peekitem(0)[0])  # This line is expected to output the smallest item in the rotated dict
